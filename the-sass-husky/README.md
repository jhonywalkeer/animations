## ðŸ’» Repository Summary

I decided to recreate this project that became extremely famous by applying new concepts and colors, in addition to reinforcing my knowledge in preprocessors

## ðŸ›  Technologies

#### Project was built using **HTML** and **SASS** but what is it?

- **HTML** - Or HyperText Markup Language, which means: "Hypertext Markup Language" is a markup language used in the construction of the "skeleton" of web pages.

- **SASS** - Is a CSS extension language that allows us to do things far beyond what we are used to doing normally. With it, we can create variables, separate our CSS into modules, create functions, implement programming logic, and much more.

## ðŸ”¨ Local Installation

You will need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) in the most up-to-date version installed on your computer to continue.

```bash
$ cd the-sass-husky
$ code .
```

And now to run our game locally just open the `index.html` file and open it with the **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** extension
